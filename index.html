            <h3>Kevin Durant </h3>
            <small>Age, 30</small>
            <small>Golden State Warriors</small>
            <p>Two championships, two final mvps in the past two years make Kevin Durant the most prized free agent. His shooting prowess, exceptional height, and guard-like moves makes him a nightmare to guard. Pair that with his ability to defend the paint and the wing at a high level and you start to understand why many are calling him the best player in the world. His top 3 destinations are the New York Knicks, Golden State Warriors, and Los Angeles Clippers.</p>

            <h3>Kyrie Irving </h3>
            <small>Age, 27</small>
            <small>Boston Celtics</small>
            <p>Kyrie's decision on what team he will be on this summer is the most unsure. With that being said, a plethora of teams will extend out to him, in hopes of adding a premier offensive specialist to their team. His all-time level ball handling skills, finesse, and ability to score from anywhere makes him a top 3 point guard in this league. His top destinations are the New York Knicks, Los Angeles Lakers, and Brooklyn Nets.</p>

            <h3>Kawhi Leonard </h3>
            <small>Age, 27</small>
            <small>Toronto Raptors</small>
            <p>If Kevin Durant is a Ferrari then Kawhi Leonard is the Lamborghini. Their value is elite on both the offensive and defensive ends, the margin between the two is slim. He can give you 30+ points on a game while holding the star player on the other team to 15. Kawhi only has two destinations this summer, resigning with the Toronto Raptors and signing with the Los Angeles Clippers. </p>

            <h3>Klay Thompson  </h3>
            <small>Age, 29</small>
            <small>Golden State Warriors</small>
            <p>The quintessence of 3 and D, he guards the best guard on the court and comes down to hit threes in their face. Klay Thompson is a great addition to any team because he doesn't demand the ball on offense but still finds a way to average 20 a night. Not to mention that when he gets hot he's liable to off for 60, and he doesn't need dribbling to do it. The embodiment of a catch and shoot specialist. His top destinations are Golden State Warriors, Los Angeles Lakers, and Boston Celtics. </p>
